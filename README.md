## 🛠️ How to Run the Code

1. **Compile a Java file:**
   ```sh
   javac path/to/YourFile.java
   ```

2. **Run the compiled class:**
   ```sh
   java path.to.YourFile
   ```

> **Tip:** For files using packages, run the command from the root directory and use the fully qualified class name (e.g., `java oops.oops2.Greeting`).
